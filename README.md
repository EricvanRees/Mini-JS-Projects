## Mini JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a series of small projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Here's a short description of each project and the core concepts that are applied:

1) Simple Color Flipper - Four buttons change the background color using a simple JS script
2) Random Quote Generator - From an array of quotes, a new quote is generated by clicking a button and added to the screen.
3) Stopwatch - using SetInterval(), a stopwatch counts the minutes, seconds, and hours. A reset restarts the count, while a "stop" button pauses the stopwatch.
4) Palindrome Checker - The value of an input field is evaluated. If it is a palindrome, an Alert message shows up stating "String is a palindrome".
5) Todo List - Values of an input box are added to the DOM, along with a delete button to delete the item.
6) Hex and Simple Color Picker - The user can choose between adding a hex color or "simple" color. A box shows the displayed color name and the background color is added.
   A JS file generates a random hex value.
7) A counter value is generated dynamically and displayed when clicking a "decrease" or "increase" button. Depending on whether the value is positive or negative, the color value changes.
8) A JS script calculates the current day of the week and the current time. Flexbox is used to style the page.    
9) An HTML page that automatically refreshes when a button is clicked, so that a new image is loaded as an HTML object from Lorem Picsum.
